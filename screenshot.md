# Screenshots and Design Notes

## Application Design

The application is designed with a modern, clean interface using DaisyUI components. The primary screens include:

1. **Main Interface**: Selection of user bio, entry creation, and tag management
2. **Theme Selector**: Quick access to theme customization
3. **Command Preview**: Shows the exact Day One CLI command being used

## Sample Interface Screenshots

Since actual screenshots aren't available, these would typically show:

1. The main application interface with a bio selected
2. The tag selection interface with custom tags
3. The date picker for custom dates
4. The command preview showing the CLI command
5. The theme selector dropdown

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Clean interface that focuses on content creation
2. **Transparency**: Shows exactly what commands are being executed
3. **Flexibility**: Multiple options for customizing entries
4. **Consistency**: Maintains Day One's design aesthetic while providing additional functionality

## Future UI Enhancements

- Journal selection dropdown
- Photo attachment support
- Location tagging
- Saved templates for quick entry creation
- Dark/light mode toggle independent of theme selection
